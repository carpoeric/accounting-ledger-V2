## Project Summary

This project's intention is to understand the ins and outs of collaborating with a team in real time while revitalizing an existing application to improve functionality, performance, and user experience. As stated above, we collectively chose to revamp one of our first projects in this course, the accounting ledger. The revamped addition of this project is a testament to what we have learned from day 1 to today.
